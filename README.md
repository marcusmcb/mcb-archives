Built with React, Amplify & Material-UI (so far).

NOTE:

Backend failing on Amplify side.  Missing NPM for @material-ui/core/box.  Attempting local NPM install fails, "no such file/directory"

Future dev:

* add a faint neon-glow/pulse backdrop to titlebar title
* ^ if that works, apply the same to hover on links
* move box contents to db
    1) set content template for each page
    2) fill as needed on query by type
    3) def future dev before adding too much content
* add bevel to link bar, size height down just a smidge
* check ui on smaller vps (and xx/xl too)
* stream page for third panel? (clubjam, etc)
